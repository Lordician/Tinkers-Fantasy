# Tinkers-Fantasy
The fantasy of every tinkerer about!

This project is designed to work with Tinkers Construct and pretty much my first actual self made mod for Minecraft.
I have a lot of ideas for this mod of which i wrote most of it down in the projects tab on the github.

I would like to thank some other mods (or well, their creators) for being open source, making it them a useful example or in some cases even sources for some useful pieces of code.
Be sure to check these out:
- Tinkers Defense
- (Un-official port of) PoleArms (I used their code for the extended reach, works really well and is well written overall)
- PlusTiC
And naturally, Tinker's Construct.
